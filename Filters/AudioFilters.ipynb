    "## Common practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Although ultimately we will design digital filters, in audio applications it is important to become familiar with the main ideas behind _analog_ filter design and analysis; indeed, audio recording and production techniques have been developed and fine-tuned well before the advent of DSP and, even in today's world of DAWs, the language and many of the practices in current use still reflect the analog conventions of yore.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular:\n",
    " * filter specifications are almost always expressed in terms of real-world frequencies in Hz rather than as normalized frequencies over $[-\\pi, \\pi]$; this of course implies that the underlying sampling frequency is known\n",
    " * plots of the magnitude response will usually be shown on a log-log graph, generally using a decibel scale for the amplitde and a decade scale for frequencies; this mirrors the way in which  human audio perception is approximately logarithmic both in frequency and in scale.\n",
    " \n",
    "The companion notebook ``FilterUtils.ipynb`` implements a set of plotting routines that take these conventions into account. For example, this is how the magnitude response of the same leaky integrator looks like in the typical representations used in communication systems vs. audio equalization:"

    "# The biquad design strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The next section provides a set of functions to compute the five biquad filter coefficients for a desired response (lowpass, bandpass, etc) and an associated set of specifications (cutoff, attenuation, etc). Rather than tackling the search for the coefficients as an abstract optimization problem, each recipe starts from a well-known _analog_ second-order filter with the desired characteristic, and then converts it to a discrete-time filter using a mapping called the _bilinear transform_ .\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this approach is that the classic analog filter prototypes (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) (and the topologies used for their implementation) are extremely well understood and have proven extremely reliable over more than a century of research and practical experimentation. "

    "Historically, the development of electronic filters began with the design of **passive** analog filters, that is, filters using only resistors, capacitors and inductors; indeed, an RLC circuit, that is, a network containing a resistor, a capacitor and an inductor, can implement the prototypical analog second-order section. Since these filters have no active elements that can provide signal amplification, the power of their output is at most equal to (but, in practice, smaller than) the power of the input. This implicitly guarantees the stability of these systems although, at least in theory, strong resonances can appear in the frequency response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analog filters work by exploiting the frequency-dependent reactance of capacitors and inductors. The input-output characteristic for linear circuits using these electronic components is described by linear differential equations, which implies the existence of some form of _feedback_ in the circuits themselves. As a consequence, when we convert the analog prototypes to digital realizations, we invariably end up with IIR filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Passive filters operating in the frequency range of audio applications require the use of bulky inductors and therefore **active** filters are usually preferred in the analog domain. In the digital domain, on the other hand, we are in fact free to use arbitrary gain factors (it's just multiplications!) and so the resulting transfer functions can approximate either type of design.

    "\n",
    "An analog filter is described by a transfer function $H(s)$, with $s\\in \\mathbb{C}$, which is the Laplace transform of the filter's continuous-time impulse response. The key facts about $H(s)$ are:\n",
    " * filter stability requires that all the poles of $H(s)$ lie in the left half of the complex plane (i.e. their real part must be negative)\n",
    " * the filter's frequency response is given by $H(j\\Omega)$, that is, by the values of $H(s)$ along the imaginary axis\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/bilinear.png\" alt=\"rlc\" style=\"float: right; width: 300px; margin: 10px 0;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The bilinear transform maps the complex $z$-plane (discrete time) to the complex $s$-plane (continuous time) as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    s \\leftarrow c \\frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}} = \\Phi_{c}(z)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c$ is a real-valued constant. Given a stable analog filter $H(s)$, the transfer function of its discrete-time version is $H_d(z) = H(\\Phi_{c}(z))$ and it is relatively easy to verify that\n",
    " * the inside of the unit circle on the $z$-plane is mapped to the left half of the $s$-plane, which preserves stability\n",
    " * the unit circle on the $z$-plane is mapped to the imaginary axis of the $s$-plane\n",
    " \n",
    "The last property allows us to determine the frequency response of the digital filter as $H_d(e^{j\\omega}) = H(\\Phi_{c}(e^{j\\omega})) = H(j\\,c\\tan(\\omega/2))$, or: \n",

    "we can see that $\\omega=0$ is mapped to $\\Omega=0$, $\\omega=\\pi/2$ is mapped to $\\Omega=c$, and $\\omega=\\pi$ is mapped to $\\Omega=\\infty$, which reveals the high nonlinearity of the frequency mapping. We usually need to precisely control a least one notable point $H_d(e^{j\\omega_0})$ in the frequency response of the discrete-time filter; for example, in a resonator, we need to place the magnitude peak at a specific frequency $\\omega_0$. To achieve this, we design the analog filter so that $H(1j) = H_d(e^{j\\omega_0})$ and then we set $c = 1/\\tan(\\omega_0/2)$ in the bilinear operator; this adjustment, called **pre-warping** , is used in the recipes below.

Linear phase, however, is not terribly relevant in audio applications because of the limited phase sensitivity in the human auditory system. On the other hand, especially in real-time applications, the primary goal in audio processing is to minimize the overall processing delay; since linear phase FIRs have a symmetric impulse response, and since a well-performing filter will have a very long impulse response, the associated delay often makes FIRs difficult to use. Even if we give up linear phase and implement an asymmetric, minimum-phase FIR, the computational cost may be too high.\n",
